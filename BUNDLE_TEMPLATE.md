## Quick Reference

### Product IDs (from ShopPage.tsx)
- '1' = Cuticle Oil (R140)
- '2' = Vitamin Primer (R210)
- '3' = Prep Solution (R200)
- '4' = Top Coat (R190)
- '5' = Fairy Dust Top Coat (R195)

### Tips for Creating Bundles
1. **Pricing**: Aim for 10-25% discount to make bundles attractive
2. **Product Selection**: Group complementary products that are often used together
3. **Images**: Create custom bundle images showing all products together
4. **Descriptions**: Clearly explain the value proposition and what customers get
5. **Badge**: Always include both "Bundle" and "Save X%" badges for visibility

### Calculating Savings
```javascript
// Original total price
const originalTotal = product1Price + product2Price + product3Price;

// Your bundle price (discounted)
const bundlePrice = 500; // Your chosen price

// Calculate savings
const savings = originalTotal - bundlePrice;
const savingsPercentage = Math.round((savings / originalTotal) * 100);

// Use in badges: ['Bundle', `Save ${savingsPercentage}%`]
```
