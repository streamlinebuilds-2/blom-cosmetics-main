## 🎯 What's Next - In Order of Priority

### Option 1: **Complete Product Migration to Supabase** ⭐ (Recommended Next)
**Why:** Currently you have 900+ lines of hardcoded product data in `ShopPage.tsx`. This needs to be moved to the database.

**Files to update:**
- `src/pages/ShopPage.tsx` - Change from hardcoded array to Supabase query
- Create migration to populate products table from CSV

**Impact:** 
- Easier to add/edit products (just edit CSV and run seed script)
- Better performance (database query vs large JS array)
- Scalable to thousands of products

**Time:** 30 minutes

---

### Option 2: **Add Error Boundaries** 🔴
**Why:** If any page crashes, the whole app breaks. Error boundaries catch errors and show a fallback.

**Files to create:**
- Update `src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx` (already exists but needs enhancements)
- Add boundaries to critical pages (Checkout, Account, Shop)

**Impact:**
- Better user experience (graceful error handling)
- Easier debugging
- Professional error messages instead of blank screen

**Time:** 20 minutes

---

### Option 3: **Optimize Images with Lazy Loading** 📸
**Why:** Currently all images load immediately, slowing down the site.

**Files to update:**
- `src/components/ProductCard.tsx` - Add lazy loading
- `src/pages/HomePage.tsx` - Optimize hero images
- `src/pages/ShopPage.tsx` - Lazy load product images

**Impact:**
- 50-70% faster page loads
- Better mobile experience
- Reduced bandwidth usage

**Time:** 30 minutes

---

### Option 4: **Add Sentry Error Tracking** 📊
**Why:** You can't see errors happening in production without it.

**Impact:**
- Know when users encounter errors
- Track error frequency
- Get alerts for critical bugs

**Time:** 15 minutes (requires Sentry account signup)

---

### Option 5: **Write Unit Tests** 🧪
**Why:** Prevent bugs before they reach production.

**Impact:**
- Catch bugs early
- Safer to make changes
- Professional development practice

**Time:** 2-3 hours

---

## 💡 My Recommendation

**Do these next in order:**

1. **Add Error Boundaries** (Quick win, protects users)
2. **Optimize Image Loading** (Improves performance immediately)  
3. **Complete Product Migration** (Solidifies architecture)

This will take about 1.5 hours total and give you the biggest improvements.
