## 🎯 WHY YOUR ORDER MISSED INVOICE GENERATION

**The Problem**: 
- Order was created successfully ✅
- Customer never reached Order Confirmation Page ❌
- No "View Invoice" button was clicked ❌
- PayFast webhook never processed ❌

**Normal Flow**:
1. Customer orders → Order Confirmation Page → "View Invoice" button → ✅ Invoice
2. OR: Customer pays → PayFast ITN → Automatic invoice generation → ✅ Invoice

**Your Order**: Created but never triggered either workflow
