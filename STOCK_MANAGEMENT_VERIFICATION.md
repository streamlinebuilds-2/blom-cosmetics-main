# Stock Management System Verification Guide

## Overview
This document explains the fixes implemented for the BLOM Cosmetics order and stock management system, and provides testing procedures to verify everything is working correctly.

## Issues Identified & Fixed

### 1. **CRITICAL: Stock Not Deducted on Order Payment**
- **Problem**: When orders were marked as "paid", stock quantities were not being reduced
- **Impact**: Inventory levels remained incorrect, leading to overselling
- **Fix**: Created automatic triggers that deduct stock when order status changes to "paid"

### 2. **Missing Stock Movement Tracking**
- **Problem**: No audit trail of inventory changes
- **Impact**: Unable to track sales, restocks, or inventory adjustments
- **Fix**: Created comprehensive `stock_movements` table with full audit trail

### 3. **No Stock Validation**
- **Problem**: Orders could be created even with insufficient stock
- **Impact**: Overselling and customer dissatisfaction
- **Fix**: Added pre-order stock validation

### 4. **Missing Analytics**
- **Problem**: No sales or inventory analytics available
- **Impact**: Poor business intelligence and inventory management
- **Fix**: Created analytics views and reporting functions

## Database Changes Made

### New Table: `stock_movements`
```sql
CREATE TABLE public.stock_movements (
  id uuid PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  product_id uuid NOT NULL REFERENCES public.products(id),
  variant_id uuid REFERENCES public.product_variants(id),
  order_id uuid REFERENCES public.orders(id),
  order_item_id uuid REFERENCES public.order_items(id),
  delta integer NOT NULL, -- Positive for increases, negative for decreases
  reason text NOT NULL, -- 'sale', 'restock', 'adjustment'
  reference text, -- External reference
  metadata jsonb, -- Additional data
  created_by uuid REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at timestamptz DEFAULT now()
);
```

### New Triggers & Functions

1. **Auto Stock Deduction**: When order status changes to "paid"
2. **Stock Validation**: Before creating order items
3. **Stock Update**: Automatic inventory updates from movements
4. **Analytics Functions**: For reporting and insights

## Testing Procedures

### 1. Apply the Migration
Run the migration manually in Supabase SQL Editor:
1. Go to Supabase Dashboard → SQL Editor
2. Copy and paste the content from: `supabase/migrations/20251127000000_fix_stock_deduction_complete.sql`
3. Execute the migration

### 2. Verify Database Structure
Run these queries to confirm the fix is applied:

```sql
-- Check stock_movements table exists
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name = 'stock_movements';

-- Check triggers exist
SELECT trigger_name, event_manipulation, event_object_table 
FROM information_schema.triggers 
WHERE trigger_name LIKE '%stock%' OR trigger_name LIKE '%order%';

-- Check functions exist
SELECT proname FROM pg_proc WHERE proname LIKE '%stock%';
```

### 3. Test Order Flow
1. **Create a test order** through the website
2. **Check initial stock** levels in products table
3. **Mark order as paid** (via PayFast ITN or manual update)
4. **Verify stock was deducted**:
```sql
-- Before payment
SELECT id, name, inventory_quantity FROM products WHERE id = 'PRODUCT_ID';

-- After payment - check stock movements
SELECT * FROM stock_movements WHERE order_id = 'ORDER_ID';

-- After payment - verify stock decreased
SELECT id, name, inventory_quantity FROM products WHERE id = 'PRODUCT_ID';
```

### 4. Test Stock Validation
Try to create an order with insufficient stock - should fail with validation error.

### 5. Test Analytics
```sql
-- Get stock analytics
SELECT * FROM stock_analytics ORDER BY name;

-- Get movement summary
SELECT * FROM get_stock_movement_summary();
```

## Manual Testing Steps

### Step 1: Check Current Stock Levels
```sql
SELECT p.id, p.name, p.inventory_quantity, p.track_inventory
FROM products p
WHERE p.track_inventory = true
ORDER BY p.name;
```

### Step 2: Create Test Order (Frontend)
1. Add products to cart
2. Go through checkout process
3. Note the order number and product IDs

### Step 3: Verify Order Creation
```sql
SELECT id, order_number, status, payment_status, created_at
FROM orders
WHERE order_number = 'TEST_ORDER_NUMBER';
```

### Step 4: Check Order Items
```sql
SELECT oi.*, p.name as product_name
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON p.id = oi.product_id
WHERE oi.order_id = (SELECT id FROM orders WHERE order_number = 'TEST_ORDER_NUMBER');
```

### Step 5: Mark Order as Paid (Simulate PayFast)
```sql
UPDATE orders 
SET status = 'paid', payment_status = 'paid', paid_at = now()
WHERE order_number = 'TEST_ORDER_NUMBER';
```

### Step 6: Verify Stock Deduction
```sql
-- Check stock movements were created
SELECT sm.*, p.name as product_name
FROM stock_movements sm
JOIN products p ON p.id = sm.product_id
WHERE sm.order_id = (SELECT id FROM orders WHERE order_number = 'TEST_ORDER_NUMBER');

-- Verify product stock decreased
SELECT p.id, p.name, p.inventory_quantity
FROM products p
WHERE p.id IN (
  SELECT product_id FROM order_items 
  WHERE order_id = (SELECT id FROM orders WHERE order_number = 'TEST_ORDER_NUMBER')
);
```

## Expected Results

### ✅ Success Indicators
- [ ] `stock_movements` table exists
- [ ] Triggers are active
- [ ] Order creation works normally
- [ ] Stock is automatically deducted when order status = 'paid'
- [ ] Stock movements are logged with reason = 'sale'
- [ ] Product inventory quantities are updated
- [ ] Analytics views return data
- [ ] No overselling occurs

### ❌ Error Indicators
- [ ] Orders marked as paid but stock unchanged
- [ ] Missing stock movement records
- [ ] Trigger errors in logs
- [ ] Product inventory negative or unchanged

## Frontend Integration Points

### Checkout Page
- Stock validation should prevent overselling
- Product availability should be real-time

### Order Management
- Admin should see stock movement history
- Inventory reports should be accurate

### Analytics Dashboard
- Sales data should reflect actual stock movements
- Inventory reports should be accurate

## Troubleshooting

### If Stock Is Not Being Deducted:
1. Check triggers exist and are enabled
2. Check function permissions
3. Verify order status changes trigger the function
4. Check Supabase logs for errors

### If Orders Fail to Create:
1. Check stock validation function
2. Verify product stock levels
3. Check for constraint violations

### If Analytics Show No Data:
1. Check stock_movements table has records
2. Verify views are created correctly
3. Check function permissions

## Next Steps

1. **Apply the migration** in Supabase SQL Editor
2. **Run test scenarios** above
3. **Monitor production orders** to ensure stock deduction works
4. **Set up alerts** for inventory thresholds
5. **Create admin dashboard** for stock management
